- [ ] Variable list could be handled more accurately in
  regard to attributes. See Ovmf sources
- [-] Create Windows User-mode application for EFI variables enumeration
  - [ ] Call directly into gRT->GetNextVariable() from
    windows driver
    - [ ] Possible?
  - [-] Hook GetVariable/SetVariable to obtain variable list
    from runtime
    - [X] Possible?
      - Yep
    - [ ] Implement
- [-] WinDBG extension to enumerate variables
  - [ ] Hook GetVariable/SetVariable to obtain variable list from runtime
  - [X] Hook SetVariable and maintain variable list
- [ ] Other options to enumerate runtime drivers
  - [ ] Scan EfiRuntimeServicesCode memory regions
  - [ ] Utilize PI 2.0 gEfiRuntimeArchProtocolGuid
- [ ] Other options to enumerate Nvram variables
  - [ ] Reverse engineer VariableSmm.efi
- [ ] Variable values
  - [ ] No variable values are cached atm. Can we do better?
- [ ] BS-only varibles should not be enumerated at runtime
  - confirmed by looking at FindVariableEx() in
    MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/RuntimeDxe/VariableParsing.c
  - on real BIOSes they are enumerated, though
- OVMF fails to return attributes in response to GetVariable()
- [ ] implement !findefivars
- add signature to efi runtime driver list
  - and implement !findruntime
